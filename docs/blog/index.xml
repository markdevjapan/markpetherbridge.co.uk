      <description>Blockchain, you have heard of it right? It&amp;rsquo;s the one that is more notably recognised as being synonymously linked to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

      <description>This article is intended to be a short and sweet.
At work and for one of our projects we use Amazon Polly and I was assigned a JIRA ticket today to handle an error with the call to the API. At some point our application has grown bigger than originally expected and we are now getting the following error: ThrottlingException: Rate exceeded.
I feel that I must also point out that this is a great example of bad planning and as a developer you should always plan and build your applications with scalability in mind.</description>

      <description>Sometimes you need to do some work quickly, and a manual WordPress migration is not known for being easy. This is where plugins like All-in-One WP Migration come in handy. However, at the moment there is a very small upload limit and if you are not in a position to pay for the upgrade or just don&amp;rsquo;t have the time there is a very quick hack you can do to increase the limit.</description>
